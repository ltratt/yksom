/// A contiguous stack of SOM values. This stack does minimal or no checking on important
/// operations and users must ensure that they obey the constraints on each function herein, or
/// undefined behaviour will occur.
///
/// The basic layout of the stack is as a series of function frames growing from the beginning of
/// the stack upwards. On a 64-bit machine, a function frame looks roughly like:
///
///   0    :     <arg 0>
///               ...
///              <arg n>
///   n * 8:     <var 0>
///              ...
///              <var m>
///   (n+m)*8:   <block 0>
///              ...
///              <block p>
///   (n+m+p)*8: <working stack>
///
/// The compiler and VM treat <arg 0> as special: it always contains a reference to `self` (hence
/// all functions have 1 extra parameter over those specified by the user). Functions are expected
/// to be called with their arguments already in place on the stack, and the stack pointer pointing
/// to after the arguments but before the variables (i.e. the function will then set up its
/// variables however it wants). Similarly, when a function is returned, the return value is
/// expected to be placed where <arg 0> was originally found (i.e. at the end of the previous
/// function's working stack). A functions `Block`s are cached after the variables, saving us from
/// repeatedly allocating `UpVar`s for blocks in tight loops.
